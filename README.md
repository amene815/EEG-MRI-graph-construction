This repo contains the python notebook `centrality_measures.ipynb` that contains our main results

The `centrality_explore.ipynb` contains some exploration but is not well documented. 
The folder `correlation` contains data from each participant for each experiement. 

All other files assisted us in constructing our graphs.
